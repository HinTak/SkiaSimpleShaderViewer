# SkiaSimpleShaderViewer
A simple [Skia Shader Language (SkSL)](https://skia.org/docs/user/sksl/) viewer written in Delphi using [Skia4Delphi](https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi). This is a FireMonkey application, so should work on any platform (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux) but only tested on Windows currently.

Includes a selection of [Shaders](/shaders/) I adapted from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) by [translating from GLSL to SkSL](SkSL-Overview.md), crediting the original sources.

Build [Delphi 11.1 Alexandria](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [Skia4Delphi 3.4](https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi)
