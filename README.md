# SkiaSimpleShaderViewer
A simple Skia Shader Language (SkSL) viewer written in Delphi with Skia4Delphi.

Includes a selection of Shaders I adapted from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) by translating from GLSL to SkSL.

Build [Delphi 11.1 Alexandria](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [Skia4Delphi 3.4](https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi)
